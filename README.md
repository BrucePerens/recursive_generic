# recursive_generic

Implementation of a pseudo-generic that contains itself without use of
recursively-defined aliases, which are problematical and/or broken
in the compiler.

## Usage

`require "recursive_generic"`

Use the `recursive_generic` macro to declare generics which contain
themselves without use of recursively-defined aliases.
```crystal
recursive_generic(MyHash, Hash, {Symbol, String|MyHash|Array(MyHash)})
recursive_generic(MyArray, Array, {String|MyArray|MyHash})
```

### Arguments:

name: The name of the new generic class to create.

generic: The name of the generic class that will be wrapped by our new
  class. This will be `Array`, `Hash`, etc.

datatype: A tuple containint the type of data in the generic.

mutate_key: The name of a function that mutates the keys or indices
           in the wrapped generic, and the key or index values used
           to query the wrapped generic. It takes the given key or index as
           its argument, and returns the mutated key or index. So, for
           example, this function would make all of the keys strings as
           they are inserted in a hash.
           ```crystal
           def mutate(key)
             key.to_s
           end
           ```

mutate_value: The name of a function that mutates values as they are
           inserted in the generic. It takes the given value as
           its argument, and returns the mutated value. So, for example,
           this function would make all of the values strings as they
           are inserted in a hash:
           ```crystal
           def mutate(key)
             key.to_s
           end
           ```
