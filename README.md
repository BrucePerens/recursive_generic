# recursive_generic

WARNING - THIS IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, NOT READY FOR YOU TO USE.

Implementation of a pseudo-generic that contains itself without use of
recursively-defined aliases, which are problematical and/or broken
in the compiler.

## Usage

`require "recursive_generic"`

Use the `recursive_generic` macro to declare generic classes which contain
themselves without use of recursively-defined aliases. You may then
instantiate them as you would a normal class.
```crystal
recursive_generic(MyHash, Hash, {Symbol, String|MyHash|Array(MyHash)})
h = MyHash.new
h[:itself] = h
```

This works by wrapping the value stored in the generic in a struct that itself
contains the specified types, and wrapping the generic in a class that handles
wrapping and unwrapping of values.

The code presently assumes that the wrapped generic implements the methods of
`Iterable` and `Enumerable` (usually by including them) and that the value
implements the methods of `Comparable`.

### Arguments:

- **name:** The name of the new self-containing generic class to create.

- **generic:** The name of a generic class that our new one will be based upon.
  This will be `Array`, `Hash`, etc.

- **datatype:** A tuple containing the type of data that will be stored in the
  generic. For an `Array` containing `Int32`, this would be `{ Int32 }`. For
  a `Hash` with `Symbol` typed keys and `String` typed values, this would be
  `{ Symbol, String }`.

- **mutate_key:** The name of a function that mutates the keys or indices
           in the wrapped generic, and the key or index values used
           to query the wrapped generic. It takes the given key or index as
           its argument, and returns the mutated key or index. So, for
           example, this function would make all of the keys strings as
           they are inserted in a hash.
           ```crystal
           def mutate(key)
             key.to_s
           end
           ```

- **mutate_value:** The name of a function that mutates values as they are
           inserted in the generic. It takes the given value as
           its argument, and returns the mutated value. So, for example,
           this function would make all of the values strings as they
           are inserted in a hash:
           ```crystal
           def mutate(key)
             key.to_s
           end
           ```

## Utilities

Although this shard contains delegation methods for common generics, you may
have to write new ones for a generic that isn't yet supported by this shard.
Thus, there is an extended `delegate` method which you can access by
including `RecursiveWrapper::Delegate`.

```crystal
macro delegate(method, to, wrap = nil, unwrap = nil, return result = nil, form = nil)
```

Delegate a method. This has additional options over the normal version
of `delegate`. It doesn't work with blocks.

### Arguments

- **wrap:** This named argument can be:

  - **:key** or **:index** : wrap one positional (not named) argument in mutate_key().

  - **:value** : wrap one positional argument in our value-wrapper struct.

  - **:key_value** : wrap two positional arguments. The first is wrapped in
    mutate_key(), the second in our value-wrapper struct.

  - **:uwrap** : unwrap the first positional argument from our value-wrapper
    struct, by passing it as `argument.value`.

  The default is to pass on all arguments without modification.
  Named arguments are passed on without modification except when
  `form: :one_argument` is set (see below).

- **return:** This named argument can be:

  - **:unwrap** : unwrap the returned value from our value-wrapper struct.

  **:self** :   return `self`.

  The default is to return the unmodified value of the delegated method.

  (The method to declare keywords like `return` as argument names is
  documented under
  <https://crystal-lang.org/reference/syntax_and_semantics/default_values_named_arguments_splats_tuples_and_overloading.html#external-names> )

- **form:** This named argument can be:

  - **:one_argument** : This is used when delegating the 
    operators `==`, `===`, `<=`, `>=`, `<=>`, and `!=`. The compiler
    insists that they be declared with only one argument, while the
    normal method of delegation declares delegated methods with
    (*positional_arguments, **named_arguments) as their argument list
    so that all positional and named arguments can be passed on to the
    delegate method. When `form: :one_argument` is used, the argument
    list of the declared method will take only one argument, and not
    pass on any named arguments.
